## Challenge 5: Design a Schema

Design a schema for tracking teams, players, and games.


## The Problem

Our production schema has over 800 tables, covering around 5 TB of data.  We
track almost all lab processes as well as assist with the management of lab
samples, lab and non-lab workflows, information security, supplies, and
financials.  This last challenge will evaluate your current understanding of
good schema design and your ability to document and present it.  For fun, it
will cover a topic unrelated to our direct work.

Design a schema that will allow our customers to track statistics about teams,
players, and games.  You may choose the sport or type of game; St. Louis is a
sports city, and the typical sports people here relate to are football,
soccer, baseball, basketball, and hockey.  However, you could also pick League
of Legends, Counter Strike, rugby, Gaelic football, Muggle Quidditch, or some
other team competition involving brackets and multiple game locations.  The
important thing here is the schema design.

We will go over your schema design in our speaking interview.

This does not require Docker.
